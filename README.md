🎉 ChatterBox 🚀💬

Fun Project

A real-time chat web app with actual photo-sharing functionality as my latest fun project, crafted with love 🌐💖 powered by:

- Vite + React
- Nodejs/Expressjs
- MongoDB (Deployed on Mongo Atlas) 
- Websockets (Using the WS npm package)

✨ ChatterBox has a lot of cool features.
- Authentication with JWT (Registration and login) ** You should definitely try signing up
- Real-time chit-chats.
- Online/Offline status indicator. You can still chat with someone if they are offline and they'll come see it later
- Auto scrolling as more messages come in
- Designed for fun-loving folks who appreciate spontaneous connections.


Even though this is a fun project, I tried to put some effort into making the UI look pretty clean. There's obviously
still a lot of room for improvement and it's nowhere close to a production-grade chat app..lol, but sheesh, I'm super
hyped for this one.

Just like for all my fun projects, you are very welcome to clone and adopt freely for your needs. 

Have an awesome weekend and don't forget to sign up and stay online. I'll probably come around to say hi!!!
